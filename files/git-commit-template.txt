# <type>: <subject>

# <body>

# <footer>

# For the title, use imperative case. For "type" use one of the following:
# - feat (new feature)
# - fix (bug fix)
# - docs (changes to documentation)
# - style (formatting, missing semicolon, etc; no code change)
# - refactor (refactoring prod code)
# - test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no prod code change)
# - chore (updating grunt tasks, etc; no prod code change)

# For the body, describe the change, if necessary. Should use imperative tone,
# if possible.

# For the footer, reference any GitHub issues or Pivotal Tracker story IDs
